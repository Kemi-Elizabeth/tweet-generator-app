# Tweet Generator App

## Description

The **Tweet Generator App** is a web application built with **Flask**, **Langchain**, and **OpenAI** that allows users to generate tweet-worthy summaries from articles. By simply providing a URL to an article, the app scrapes its content, summarizes it, and generates a tweet from the summary.

## Features

- **Article Scraping**: Input a URL, and the app scrapes the article content using `newspaper3k`.
- **Summarization**: Utilizes **Langchain** and **OpenAI** to summarize the article into a concise tweet-friendly format.
- **Tweet Generation**: Generates creative tweets based on the summary of the article.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - **HTML** and **CSS** for the user interface (UI).
  
- **Backend**: 
  - **Flask** for building the web application.
  - **Langchain** for integrating with OpenAI and generating summaries.
  - **OpenAI API** for AI-powered summarization and tweet generation.

- **Others**:
  - **Python** for the overall development and execution.
